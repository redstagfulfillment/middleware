Middleware
========
Middleware is an abstracted and lightweight version of Red Stag Fulfillment's production environment. It can be used for
developing plugins for the production environment, or as a standalone "middle-man" between your systems and ours. If you
develop your plugin according to the requirements then your plugin may be accepted as an officially supported production
plugin which can then be activated and configured in the Merchant Panel by the user in just a few clicks!


Features
--------
RSF plugins support the following features which work exactly the same in both the middleware environment (this repository)
and the production environment (closed-source).

* Run methods periodically via cron jobs (config.xml or your own linux cron jobs).
* Respond to RSF events in real time (via Webhooks if using the middleware environment).
* Respond to third-party Webhook events.

A plugin that is installed on the production environment can be configured by the user via the Merchant Panel or run in
the middleware environment with a relatively simple installation on a server running PHP. Either way, the functionality
of the plugin should be identical. While the "middleware" is intended to be mainly a development environment for testing,
you can just as well use it as the basis for your integration.


Requirements
--------

* The supported platform for developing Middleware plugins is PHP 5.4+ on Mac or Linux.
* A web server is required for testing if your plugin receives third-party webhooks or responds to events from RSF via
RSF's webhooks. Otherwise the plugins are only run from the command line or a crontab.
* [modman](https://github.com/colinmollenhour/modman) is used to deploy plugins.


Installation
--------
1. Clone this repository to a new directory and copy the sample config file.<br/>

    `$ git clone https://github.com/redstagfulfillment/middleware.git`<br/>
    `$ cd middleware`<br/>
    `$ cp app/etc/local.sample.xml app/etc/local.xml`

2. Edit app/etc/local.xml file and add your configuration.<br/>
Example:<br/>

    `<base_url>http://[WEBSITE BASE URL]/api/jsonrpc</base_url>`<br/>
    `<login>[API LOGIN]</login>`<br/>
    `<password>[API PASSWORD]</password>`<br/>

3. Clone the `Test_Test` plugin and run the `update_ip` method to confirm successful setup:<br/>

    `$ modman init`<br/>
    `$ modman clone https://github.com/redstagfulfillment/plugin-test.git`<br/>
    `$ php run.php Test_Test update_ip`

#### Windows Users

Although Windows is not supported, it should be possible to develop in Windows by using a [PHP port of modman](https://github.com/sitewards/modman-php)
or by manually creating the symlinks for a module. However, if you want your plugin to be installed on the production environment
it must operate perfectly under a Linux environment.


Create Your Own Plugin
--------
The easiest way to start your own plugin is to fork the [`Test_Test`](https://github.com/redstagfulfillment/plugin-test)
plugin and rename it. The minimal required file structure from the root of the middleware directory is as follows:<br/>

* app/code/community/{COMPANY_NAME}/{MODULE_NAME}
  * etc
    * config.xml
    * plugin.xml
  * Plugin.php
* app/etc/modules
  * {COMPANY_NAME}_{MODULE_NAME}.xml

As such, the `modman` file for the `Test_Test` plugin looks like this:

```
code             app/code/community/Test/Test/
Test_Test.xml    app/etc/modules/
```

Running Plugins
--------

Plugins can be run by executing the following command in the command line:<br/>

`$ php run.php {COMPANY_NAME}_{MODULE_NAME} {PLUGIN_METHOD}`
